      <description>Consider sentience as a critical element and predecessor of imagination.
Consciousness may just be an emergent sense from the effectiveness of associating biological incentives, feelings, to this imagination.
Hyp- PreFrontal cortex developed to revisit experience and simulate to predict complex future scenarios and trigger internal incentives toward increasing survivability in social situations. in this context memory is essential for consciousness. Empathy may be possible with out consciousness but empathy may have played a role in the evolution of self and in turn the evolution of consciousness.</description>

I did listen to this Audible book a couple months back, and presumably the machines are well aware of that, and as such are willing this related content in my direction.</description>
