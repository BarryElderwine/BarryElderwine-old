      <description>Consider sentience as a critical element and predecessor of imagination.
Consciousness may just be an emergent sense from the effectiveness of associating biological incentives, feelings, to this imagination.
Hyp- PreFrontal cortex developed to revisit experience and simulate to predict complex future scenarios and trigger internal incentives toward increasing survivability in social situations. in this context memory is essential for consciousness. Empathy may be possible with out consciousness but empathy may have played a role in the evolution of self and in turn the evolution of consciousness.</description>

      <description>Willful Hedging It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell anymore what the trends are in pop-sci-culture with the way we are fed content via the machines. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a whole lot of &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; pushed into my online notice in recent weeks. Much of this content is related to the proposition of purposelessness that Robert Sapolsky has made with his book Determined. I did listen to this Audible book a couple months back, and presumably the machines are well aware of that, and as such are willing this related content in my direction.</description>

      <description>Reasoning &amp;lsquo;A Site Four Sore Eyes&amp;rsquo; This is place where I can publish my ideas for the audience of me. I have an ever growing number of thixotropic reasons for setting up this platform. Probably the greatest overarching argument is to give me a place where I can air out my most persistent ruminations. This, in my fuzzy uncheckable logic, might - just might - provide some time and virtual space between my, in-this-moment thoughts, and my many-later-moments reconsiderations, allowing me to take them in with fresher, or simply differently focused eyes.</description>
