      <title>Evaluating Technology</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about the purpose of technology. Specifically my intuitions, based of course on my value driven biases, lead me to believe that all technology should or at least could be evaluated based on its ability to enhance some aspect of humanity and the trade-offs . I think this is supported by the fact that technology, by definition, is always a product of human innovation. This notion however may not hold true with the advent of Artificial Intelligence.</description>

      <description>Eye rubs are relatively quick thoughts that feel like they might be insightful but have not been given sufficient attention to warrant a longer form post.</description>

      <description>The following is a running list of words inspired by The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows by John Koenig These are EyeRubs

      <description>Willful Hedging It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell anymore what the trends are in pop-sci-culture with the way we are fed content via the machines. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a whole lot of &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; pushed into my online notice in recent weeks. Much of this content is related to the proposition of purposelessness that Robert Sapolsky has made with his book Determined. I did listen to this Audible book a couple months back, and presumably the machines are well aware of that, and as such are willing this related content in my direction.</description>

      <description>Reasoning &amp;lsquo;A Site Four Sore Eyes&amp;rsquo; This is place where I can publish my ideas for the audience of me. I have an ever growing number of thixotropic reasons for setting up this platform. Probably the greatest overarching argument is to give me a place where I can air out my most persistent ruminations. This, in my fuzzy uncheckable logic, might - just might - provide some time and virtual space between my, in-this-moment thoughts, and my many-later-moments reconsiderations, allowing me to take them in with fresher, or simply differently focused eyes.</description>
