      <description>Willful Hedging It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell anymore what the trends are in pop-sci-culture with the way we are fed content via the machines. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a whole lot of &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; pushed into my online notice in recent weeks. Much of this content is related to the proposition of purposelessness that Robert Sapolsky has made with his book Determined. I did listen to this Audible book a couple months back, and presumably the machines are well aware of that, and as such are willing this related content in my direction.</description>

      <description>Reasoning &amp;lsquo;A Site Four Sore Eyes&amp;rsquo; This is place where I can publish my ideas for the audience of me. I have an ever growing number of thixotropic reasons for setting up this platform. Probably the greatest overarching argument is to give me a place where I can air out my most persistent ruminations. This, in my fuzzy uncheckable logic, might - just might - provide some time and virtual space between my, in-this-moment thoughts, and my many-later-moments reconsiderations, allowing me to take them in with fresher, or simply differently focused eyes.</description>
