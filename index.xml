      <title>The Balance Between Discovery and Generativity</title>

      <description>I think it may the case that the vastness, and rapid rate of movement, of information made available by the internet has created the illusion that access to personally integrable knowledge is easier than it must actually be. Discovery is seductive. The immediacy of access to answers to every question that finds the attention offers the feeling of accomplishment of understanding. But this can&amp;rsquo;t be the case. Our brains don&amp;rsquo;t process information at this rate and if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the mind, not only the time, but also the appropriate framing of information, then this information is as fleeting in the mind as the chemical messengers that mediate the felt connection.</description>

      <title>Is there a bridge?</title>

      <description>I found the video Why I Converted to Christianity - Ayaan Hirsi Ali to be oddly reassuring. Alex O&amp;rsquo;Conner does a very nice job of revealing the both the reason and emotion behind his Ayaan&amp;rsquo;s, views, behavior and the values that underly them. This approach to discussion is nearly all but lost in everyday discourse nowadays. I&amp;rsquo;ve suggested this video to some friends and, in explaining to them why I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the time and attention, they each wanted to argue against the reasoning of Ayaan solely based on my representation of her perspectives.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Technology</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about the purpose of technology. Specifically my intuitions, based of course on my value driven biases, lead me to believe that all technology should or at least could be evaluated based on its ability to enhance some aspect of humanity and the trade-offs . I think this is supported by the fact that technology, by definition, is always a product of human innovation. This notion however may not hold true with the advent of Artificial Intelligence.</description>

      <description>Willful Hedging It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell anymore what the trends are in pop-sci-culture with the way we are fed content via the machines. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a whole lot of &amp;ldquo;free will&amp;rdquo; pushed into my online notice in recent weeks. Much of this content is related to the proposition of purposelessness that Robert Sapolsky has made with his book Determined. I did listen to this Audible book a couple months back, and presumably the machines are well aware of that, and as such are willing this related content in my direction.</description>

      <description>Reasoning &amp;lsquo;A Site Four Sore Eyes&amp;rsquo; This is place where I can publish my ideas for the audience of me. I have an ever growing number of thixotropic reasons for setting up this platform. Probably the greatest overarching argument is to give me a place where I can air out my most persistent ruminations. This, in my fuzzy uncheckable logic, might - just might - provide some time and virtual space between my, in-this-moment thoughts, and my many-later-moments reconsiderations, allowing me to take them in with fresher, or simply differently focused eyes.</description>
