Truth is, I think quite a lot about this subject and consume the content of several notable thinkers on this topic, but I don’t understand much of the detail that these thinkers assert with a certitude that unsettles me. I’m not sure if it their confidence that unsettles me or my own limitations to grasp what they’re saying sufficiently to challenge their contentions.\nI’ve recently read ‘Determined’ By Robert Sapolsky. I can’t say I find anything in this book at odds with my own thinking on the subject. This gives me some concern not because there are aspects I don’t quite get but rather because I think I get it all. But determined isn’t about consciousness. It’s about the illusion of free will. It seems to me that these two concepts are related if not\nConsciousness may be a consequence of evolution providing an adaptive lever for social cooperation. What better way to provide a selective pressure for cooperation than to develop some sense and mechanism for social alignment? A perceptual sense that provides useful stimulus in this regard might be achievable in a primitive sense of self, not necessarily in a complex form we now hold, but maybe in some more rudimentary sense that provided simple social accountability. This sense evolved into greater complexity as a stronger more broad sense of self provided better collective problem solving and distribution of increasingly complex tasks. This in turn evolved into the ability to recount and simulate situations to predict and coordinate. Maybe this led to complex language or vice versa? Either way this simulation would be what we might consider imagination. This imagination might be all there is to consciousness. From what we think we understand about how the brain relates to behavior, how it dictates behavior the entirety of this imaginative process occurs after we behave. That is to say that all of our decisions and actions are made before we imagine them, or before we become “conscious” of them. It may be these simulations are necessary to manage the temporal complexities of cooperation.\nConsider sentience as a critical element and predecessor of imagination.\nConsciousness may just be an emergent sense from the effectiveness of associating biological incentives, feelings, to this imagination.\nHyp- PreFrontal cortex developed to revisit experience and simulate to predict complex future scenarios and trigger internal incentives toward increasing survivability in social situations. in this context memory is essential for consciousness. Empathy may be possible with out consciousness but empathy may have played a role in the evolution of self and in turn the evolution of consciousness.\nCan we have consciousness without a role, or a sense of self?\n",
