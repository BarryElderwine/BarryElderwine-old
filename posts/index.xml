      <description>Self Awareness The nature of consciousness, how it&amp;rsquo;s defined, what forces and machinery is is built on, and where do those systems reside and what are their the boundaries is What will follow is more a stream of, potentially illformed, ill-informed and self conflicting hypotheses.

      <description>Reasoning &amp;lsquo;A Site Four Sore Eyes&amp;rsquo; This is place where I can publish my ideas for the audience of me. I have an ever growing number of thixotropic reasons for setting up this platform. Probably the greatest overarching argument is to give me a place where I can air out my most persistent ruminations. This, in my fuzzy uncheckable logic, might - just might - provide some time and virtual space between my, in-this-moment thoughts, and my many-later-moments reconsiderations, allowing me to take them in with fresher, or simply differently focused eyes.</description>
