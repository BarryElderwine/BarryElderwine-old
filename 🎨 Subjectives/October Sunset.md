Two weeks shy of life's celebration
The truth of it I can't comprehend
Very much of who I am
I canʼt now understand
The crimson and orange beg understanding
No bitter no sweet on my tongue
No beauty in the colors of the October sunset
The throbbing pulses in moments and days
Tidal tears momentarily mask the thoughts
Of the pulsing momentary and daily throbs
Pain I couldnʼt feel took you from me
But now I do feel it
So sorry for that constant ache
and the relief I couldnʼt provide
Your voice is still so clear in my mind
Only now am I hearing what you were trying to say
throbbing pain pulsing in moments and days
Canʼt see any beauty in the colors
The crimson and orange of the October sunset
Forever paints a bitter palate
Back again trying to feel
fear of expressing too little in words
Your presence is never to be lost
you are much of me
I canʼt... I refuse to believe that that of you that is me is lost
What rationale would bring you back
Not one iʼve ever embraced
Should i fill the empty space or embrace it and see you there forever
Your touch is still present when I close my eyes
Breathing has to be learned when they open
More than some memories
