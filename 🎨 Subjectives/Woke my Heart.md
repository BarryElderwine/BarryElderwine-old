Half my life I始d been a romantic
Came to an end in a moment
No simple lies
Didn始t know my part
Didn始t know my place either
Couldn始t feel for anyone
To touch was just a need
Wanted nothing more
Than to want nothing
And in that I had succeeded
Nearly 9 years since I'd felt any comfort
No explanation for what she did
Or how
In a moment - after an infinite many passed
She woke my heart
