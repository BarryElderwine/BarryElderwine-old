Concept:
* Elderly rich woman is preparing to die. 
* She is being buttered up by family, friends, her church, non-profits and others
* She can't possibly spend all her money before she dies
* She decides to listen to ALL the requests and understand their needs... and weaknesses 
* She then devises a plan to write a will and plant seeds that ensures ALL interested parties fight to get the share they feel entitled to and ALL end up losing not only what they feel they are entitles to but also everything they own.
