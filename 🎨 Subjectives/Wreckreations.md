# **Beautiful Wonder**

Summer Showers Shimmer

Is Mother's Touch

To remind us

to look through the artifice

  

Clowered Castles 

and Misdirection

the surface of our ambled ways

  

----- Chorus----

Dawn's Light

Paints a picture

No lines

Emerging Colors

Three sides

forgiving, grateful, giving

revealing

A beautiful wonder

-----------------------

# **October Sunset**

Two weeks shy of life's celebration

The truth of it I can't comprehend 

Very much of who I am 

I can’t now understand 

  

The crimson and orange beg understanding 

No bitter no sweet on my tongue 

No beauty in the colors of the October sunset

  

The throbbing pulses in moments and days 

Tidal tears momentarily mask the thoughts 

Of the pulsing momentary and daily throbs 

  

Pain I couldn’t feel took you from me

But now I do feel it 

So sorry for that constant ache 

and the relief I couldn’t provide

  

Your voice is still so clear in my mind 

Only now am I hearing what you were trying to say

  

throbbing pain pulsing in moments and days

Can’t see any beauty in the colors 

The crimson and orange of the October sunset

Forever paints a bitter palate 

Back again trying to feel 

fear of expressing too little in words

Your presence is never to be lost

you are much of me 

I can’t... I refuse to believe that that of you that is me is lost 

What rationale would bring you back 

Not one i’ve ever embraced

  

Should i fill the empty space or embrace it and see you there forever

  

Your touch is still present when I close my eyes

Breathing has to be learned when they open

  

More than some memories

# **Sirens**

Sirens

I hear Sirens

Where are they coming from

Who Are they for

  

Sirens 

Silence the sirens

What do they mean 

Can I ignore 

them

  

  

Second Chances have always been

# **Woke my Heart**

Half my life I’d been a romantic 

Came to an end in a moment

No simple lies

Didn’t know my part

Didn’t know my place either

  

Couldn’t feel for anyone

To touch was just a need

Wanted nothing more

Than to want nothing

And in that  I had succeeded 

  

Nearly 9 years since I'd felt any comfort

No explanation for what she did 

Or how 

In a moment - after an infinite many passed 

She woke my heart
