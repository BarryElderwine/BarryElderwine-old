- most of that decision making is done by our bodies based on human nature

We organize for the short term rush thinking it gives us control of the long term outcome. Or is it just that we can manage our thoughts better that way?
Predictability = security

Iʼm writing this in part as an explanation to myself as to why I canʼt seem to produce. I enjoy research and ideating but rarely turn those efforts into anything captured much less anything developed and released.
A consequence of this is frustration, not only for the lack of productivity, but also for the persistent rehashing of the ideas that consume my every mental moment. I do find that while these ideas are constantly running through my mind, it is very difficult, actually to this point, seemingly impossible, to clearly capture these ideas in a coherent manner. The illusive aspect of turning these thoughts into language has only recently come to my recognition. That is to say, that the ideas seem clearly formed in
my head for when I try to write them down the words and structure are exceedingly difficult to find. So then why “Why we organize” as the opening section? Getting to the point, my fallback for dealing with this frustration is to identify all the ideas and pieces I can and put them into an organized structure. This can be immensely gratifying and gives me the illusion of productivity. But that said, I have never been able to maintain that
organization for very long. Further, the organization rarely translates into production. 

Why am I so able to organize but so incapable to producing?
Ultimately the foundational assumption of this book is that:
Our behavior is a product of our physical constitution, our experience, how experience modifies our physical constitution and how capable our physical constitution is to adapting those experiences.
What does that mean? I will define each of those factors

Physical constitution: Every organism has innate behaviors that have evolved to ensure its survivability to reproduce.

Experience: All organisms must be able to adapt the behaviors to experience to ensure survival long enough to reproduce.

Physical constitution modification: These adapted behaviors are reinforced by changes in the chemical and structural nature of the organism. This includes neurological, chemical, hormonal and musculoskeletal.

Physical adaptability: Every individual has a unique capacity to make these
constitutional modifications and what those modifications are and to what extent they change will be constrained by that individualʼs innate adaptability in the area. In short we all develop patterns of behavior based on these factors.

Our interactions with the world drive our behavior largely based on the immediate feedback of how those experiences make us feel. I suspect that the purpose of consciousness is to afford us the ability to recollect those experiences and the associated feelings, so pattern modifications can be made to reduce the bad feelings. This is the point of deliberation, education, practice and repetition. If these feelings donʼt persist long enough in a way that can be consistently interpreted, then acting on them to change behavior can be extremely difficult. This may be where forming habits based on best practices of others could be essential to breaking out of common patterns in spite of the fact that these patterns may not reduce survivability but nonetheless may decrease quality of life. Organizing things provides some sense of control over onesʼ situation. In my case it is has felt impossible to consider producing anything if I donʼt feel in control of all the working parts and have a clear vision of how I want to assemble and use those parts to some end.

Could it be that attention deficit is a trait that gives one an advantage where they conserve the limited resource of attention giving it to many things bringing “roundedness”?
