The aspects of empathy:
* Detection - Recognition of an emotional state in others. I think the ability to this (pre)subconsciously is what is considered to be Empathy. Sociopaths are considered to have dulled emotions including a lack of ability to subconsciously identify (feel) distress in others. Cognitive empathy can compensate for this by observing physical queues.

* Sensitivity - the detection machinery is preconscious, ie, is felt to varying degrees in humans and other organisms. The degree of sensitivity may be largely hardwired but might be adjusted based on experience. Likely sufficiently significant events could enhance or dull ones sensitivity.
* Interpretation- The interpretation of those feelings is based on a combination of innate capacity and experience. I believe the over estimation of the role of innate capacity results in enormous blind spots as well as misinterpretations
