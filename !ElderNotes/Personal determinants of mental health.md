[[BE.002 Kinetics Of Action]]
Let me recap regarding personal determinants of mental health. Each of the processes below works on some time scale. It is possible, maybe even likely that, the kinetics of each of these processes is dependent on the complexity of the situation which would almost certainly include the timescale of the 'decision' that needs to be made. #OMS/hyp

Let's think through the possible mechanics of each process and the factors that might affect the kinetics.

1. Input:
- Transactional stimulus will always like require an immediate response.
- What is the form of the stimulus that requires long term planning?

2. Detect -> Process->Integrate -> Analyze 
- visual - light focused by lens onto retina converted to electrical impulse carried by neuron to brain. Though it might be that some processing and analysis is done by the retina (?) 
- audible -
- smell,
- taste,
- tactile,
- temperature
- other? 

It occurs to me that the Stimulus -> Detect -> Process -> Integrate-> Analyze
-> Decide -> Response behavior may actually forgo process, analysis and decision steps. That is, there may be situations where the timescale of response demands a more immediate response than a round trip to the brain would afford. But what would such an immediate actuation system look like, architecturally and mechanically? 

Switching gears a bit I want to think about what the role and the reality of the TPD and the DPD.

- Task Positive Network
    - This system is the part of the brain that manages analysis and decision making that drives focused behavior
    - Is this indicative of "Flow"?
- [[Default Mode Network]]
    - This system is the rumination or day dreaming

This is where my mind spends much of its time. Is there a way to control the switching such that I might get task oriented around capturing the ruminations in well defined terms? It may be that 's what I'm doing here writing down these ideas. #OMS/hyp
