I will work on being more mindful about my creative pursuits. 
In that I mean:
	In whatever creative idea I'm generating will ensure the output is intentional and sufficiently complete. 

When I pick up a guitar I will focus more on playing ideas as opposed to listening for ideas or sounds coming from my fingers. This is particularly critical when talking about muscle memory noodling. A caveat is that I need to spend some time every day looking at intervals and harmonies and giving mindful attention to these relationships. 

When I write I will capture the concepts  in their entirety without ambiguity before concerning myself with the elegance of the wording.  

When I am working anything for public release I will make my case logically in my terms. Only when editing the early clean draft  will I allow myself to consider how  others might misinterpret, take issue or straw man my message.
