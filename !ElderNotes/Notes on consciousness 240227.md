Intersection: "[[240219 Consciousness - Made with Natural and Artificial Flavors]]"
Notes:

Consider sentience as a critical element and predecessor of imagination. 

Consciousness may just be an emergent sense from the effectiveness of associating biological incentives, feelings, to this  imagination. 

Hyp- PreFrontal cortex developed to revisit experience and simulate to predict complex future scenarios and trigger internal incentives toward increasing survivability in social situations. in this context memory is essential for consciousness. 
Empathy may be possible with out consciousness but empathy may have played a role in the evolution of self and in turn the evolution of consciousness.  

Can we have consciousness without a role, or a sense of self?
