Notes: Hillaryʼs “deplorables”
---


Yesterdayʼs events really knocked me down. Saddest part to me is that most of those people protesting, I believe, were well intentioned people, thinking they were doing the right and necessary thing. No doubt there were some, maybe even many, truly deplorable people involved, but the majority were trying to do what they believed was the best thing for this country. And there was very little acknowledgement of that, at least in the sources I get my news from. Thatʼs how Trump got elected in the first place. Hillaryʼs “deplorables” comment was so destructive because it did represent the sentiment of so many and reaffirmed in the minds of those who ended up voting for Trump that their perspectives werenʼt valued. I donʼt know how we get through to “the good people on both sides” who for many reasons hold onto bad ideas. I do hope that yesterdayʼs events opened the eyes of enough people get that conversation on the right track but Iʼm not optimistic.
