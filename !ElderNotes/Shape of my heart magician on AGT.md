Watching Shin lil on Americas Got Talent a contestant  I, like most others whose attention held by magicians, was watching and trying to determine how he was achieving his illusions. He was selecting at will only playing cards with hearts in synchrony with Sting's Shape of My Heart. 

It occurred to me that I look at these feats in different ways and that determines my impression. 
If, like in this instance, I can imagine how the the feat is done, I'm impressed by the design and then the slight of hand involved. 
If, I can't imagine how a fest is accomplished, I'm first frustrated with my own lack of imagination and then impressed by the design but can't make a determination on the technical performance because I simply don't have that  information. 

What does this say about how I consider unknowns vs how those prone to mystical or otherwise irrational attribution?
