Curiosity is my strength but also a significant impediment. 
- + My curiosity allows me to focus my attention
- - When my interest is strong my desire to share is also strong, but my lack of expertise  and fear of blindspots is a barrier to participating in or initiating conversation in that area. 
- - When my understanding gets to a certain point my curiosity, and in turn, my attention wanes.
- -  My curiosity relates to my perception about other's interest in topic area. So when my curiosity wanes, both my interest in sharing wanes, and my perception that anyone else would find my understanding to be of  interest or value. 

I need to get beyond this fear. 
In this moment my hypothesis is that if I write for myself, in sufficiently complete thoughts and then let those thoughts rest without my attention for some period of time, I can be a better judge of the value of those thoughts and this might very well be a strategy to greater productivity and social engagement issues that do drive my curiosity.
