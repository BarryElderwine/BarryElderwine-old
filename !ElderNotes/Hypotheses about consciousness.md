## Hypotheses about consciousness 
- Consciousness is a simulation environment  
	- The simulation is built from experiences
	- Being mindful simply means paying attention to your specific current near-realtime experience. In other words mindfulness is attention to the present experience undistracted by other simulations. Note that this says nothing about the objective reality of that near-realtime experience. 
		- Mental health may be measured by the difference between this simulated environment and the objective reality
- Language is one interface between simulations
	- Language can be used to expand the elements of the simulated environment. 
- Empathy is another interface between simulations.
	- Empathy is limited by experience. 
- Experience is exposure to some set of circumstances described by:
	- Objects 
	- Behaviors 
	- Transformations
