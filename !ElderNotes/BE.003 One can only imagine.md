BE.003 One can only imagine One can only imagine within the limits of their experience. We are living in what appears to be the most divided moment in US History. In this statement of course Iʼm referring to the history since the beginning of the formation of the republic. It feels bold to suggest that we are now more divide than we were prior to and during the civil war and I may very well change my mind after more understanding to shift that timeline to the beginning of the Reconstruction era which may still seem too bold, but I believe the coming months, post “Insurrection” will bear more information on this point. Johnathan Heidtʼs case on this point made nearly 10 years ago is compelling. And the, what seems clearly delusional mindset of the 60% of Trump voters who still hold onto the idea that the election was stolen deserves some consideration as to what it means for human kind and the limits of our perception, reason and imagination. What are those limits? What defines their boundaries? How do they serve us as individuals and as social animals? What is perception and how and why are it constrained? What is reason and what purpose does it serve? What is imagination? Is it related to reason, a necessary function of reason or another pathway altogether?
