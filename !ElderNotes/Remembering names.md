At a social gathering tonight I was told that if I just made an effort to remember peoples' names that I would find them much more cooperative and accommodating. 

I tried to explain that this is something I've worked on since I was in 3rd grade when we did exercises to remember names with faces. 

In relationships since that elementary school exercise I have been told time and time again that if I wanted to remember I would. This has invariably proven to be an issue in romantic relationships including my marriage. 

I think it might be time that I forgive myself and let go of the idea that it is a failure of will and thoughtfulness on my part that I can't remember names. 

It has seemed as though that remembering names and other labels might indeed be easier for most people. This presents a bidirectional [[Empathy|Empathy]]gap.
