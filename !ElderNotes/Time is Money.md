Time is Money We understand the term 'Time is Money' But Time is not = money. Time is only Money to those whose earnings are tied to opportunity cost. And opportunity cost is by definition a trade of personal labor for money or other assets. Greater than 20% of the US economy is now money markets. Money made in these markets is not associated with personal labor. Is this 20% a controlling share? I mean does this 20% control the buying power of the dollar? The earning power of the dollar? What does this men for those who only make enough money to provide themselves with basic needs? Is this the core of the growing wealth gap? 

 Off the top of my head the goals are the Managing money is a skillset but has nothing to do with value to the recipient of the product rendered. That is to say that an individual could provide good product but not know how to monetize it. Further if money is made on the product rendered there is nothing to say that effective use of that money should be an expected co-skill. Then there is the decreasing need for unskilled or low skilled labor. There is a part of the population that just can't, or in the future, won't be able to work, due to limited intelligence or other personal limitations. These individuals are still of critical impact to the economy on the consumer side, in terms of feeding the economy and there conversely is the burden on the economic systems if the their basic needs aren'y met [[Capitalism]] is an effective tool, but only within the limitations of proper use. The sacralization of capitalism has hamstrung our ability to discuss how its implementation can be improved much less modified in its application. Economics is a social construct, that requires a social contract that puts constraints on its application.
