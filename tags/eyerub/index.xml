      <title>The Balance Between Discovery and Generativity</title>

      <description>I think it may the case that the vastness, and rapid rate of movement, of information made available by the internet has created the illusion that access to personally integrable knowledge is easier than it must actually be. Discovery is seductive. The immediacy of access to answers to every question that finds the attention offers the feeling of accomplishment of understanding. But this can&amp;rsquo;t be the case. Our brains don&amp;rsquo;t process information at this rate and if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the mind, not only the time, but also the appropriate framing of information, then this information is as fleeting in the mind as the chemical messengers that mediate the felt connection.</description>

      <title>Is there a bridge?</title>

      <description>I found the video Why I Converted to Christianity - Ayaan Hirsi Ali to be oddly reassuring. Alex O&amp;rsquo;Conner does a very nice job of revealing the both the reason and emotion behind his Ayaan&amp;rsquo;s, views, behavior and the values that underly them. This approach to discussion is nearly all but lost in everyday discourse nowadays. I&amp;rsquo;ve suggested this video to some friends and, in explaining to them why I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the time and attention, they each wanted to argue against the reasoning of Ayaan solely based on my representation of her perspectives.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Technology</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about the purpose of technology. Specifically my intuitions, based of course on my value driven biases, lead me to believe that all technology should or at least could be evaluated based on its ability to enhance some aspect of humanity and the trade-offs . I think this is supported by the fact that technology, by definition, is always a product of human innovation. This notion however may not hold true with the advent of Artificial Intelligence.</description>
